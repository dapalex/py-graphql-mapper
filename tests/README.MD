# py-graphql-mapper - Test

Tests have been made using:

- GeoDB Cities GraphQL API
- Github GraphQL API
- rapidapi GraphQL API


In order to launch the tests locally an API key has to be set for:

 * GeoDBCities API [here](https://github.com/dapalex/py-graphql-mapper/blob/main/tests/consts.py), available with a free subscription at https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities-graphql/
* Github API [here](https://github.com/dapalex/py-graphql-mapper/blob/main/tests/consts.py), available with a free subscription at https://github.com
* RapidAPI API [here](https://github.com/dapalex/py-graphql-mapper/blob/main/tests/consts.py), available with a free subscription at https://rapidapi.com/ApiPlaygroundTestRapidapi/api/graphql-rapidapi-test/


## Queries

## Mutations

| Scenario | Description | Test case |
|:---------|:-----------:|----------:|
| Executing a mutation with arguments as literal values | create a GraphQL Mutation to modify a GraphQL type and builds the python class instance containing the payload received from the response | [here](https://github.com/dapalex/py-graphql-mapper/blob/main/tests/tstmutation/mutation_test.py) |
| Executing a mutation manually created using only _pygqlmap_ with arguments as literal values | create a GraphQL Mutation to mutate a GraphQL type and builds the python class instance containing the payload received from the response | [here](https://github.com/dapalex/py-graphql-mapper/blob/main/tests/tstmutation/manual_mutation_test.py) |
